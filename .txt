I would like traps to cause hand size to decrease by 1 if failed. Here’s a short, clean adjustment you can plug into your AI dev prompt or drop straight into your notes:

Adjustment: 12-Room Default Dungeon

Change the core dungeon generation to:
	•	Default rooms = 12
	•	Room distribution (simple version):
	•	Rooms 1–3 → Standard enemies / traps
	•	Rooms 4–5 → Mix of standard + elite enemies
	•	Room 6 → Auto opens Store
	•	Rooms 7–9 → Harder enemies + elite spikes
	•	Room 10 → Auto opens Store
	•	Room 11 → Elite enemy
	•	Room 12 → Boss

Implementation note:
Set the global/default value:

const DEFAULT_ROOM_COUNT = 12;

And ensure the Dev Panel “Room Count” field starts at 12 instead of 6.

If you want, I can also generate the tiny code snippet to drop into app.js to override the default cleanly.
